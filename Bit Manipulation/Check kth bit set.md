### Check kth bit set or not
In order to check whether the kth bit is set or not, we can perform a simple bitwise shift operations: <br>
1. **Left Shift Operation** : To check the kth bit, you can left-shift the number by (k-1) positions and then perform a bitwise AND operation with 1. If the result is non-zero, it means the kth bit is set (1); otherwise, the kth bit is not set (0).
